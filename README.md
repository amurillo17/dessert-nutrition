# To run the app:

1) Clone the repository.
2) On the root folder, run the command `npm install`.
3) When finished installing, also on the root folder, run `npm start`: it will open a browser window with the app on `http://localhost:3000`.
4) For running the automated tests, on the "root" or the "client" folder run the command `npm test`.
